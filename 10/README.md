# [Day 10](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/10)
In Elixir

This was a very interesting day. I enjoyed it actually, even tho i struggled with the functional
mindset. A few times i just couldnt think of a way to write the code without mutable variables and
while loops, but eventually i got it. The code isnt the prettiest, but hey, it works. I still
enjoyed Elixir a lot.

## Quickstart
To run part 1 or part 2, do:
```sh
$ make part1
$ make part2
```

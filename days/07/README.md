In Rust

Part 1 is 124 lines... im very sure it could be way shorter, i just didnt really bother trying to
shorten it. Maybe later. This is my second time writing Rust and i dont think i would be able to do
much magic. For now, this is what works and im keeping it.

Part 2 code is even worse. I was too tired to come up with something better so im gonna leave it as
it is for now.

## Quickstart
To run part 1 or part 2, do:
```sh
$ make part1
$ make part2
```

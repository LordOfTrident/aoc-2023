My first time trying rust. It was a pretty fine experience, i expected it to be harder. Thankfully
this AOC day was easier so i didnt struggle with it.

Part 2 was surprising really really easy. I guess it was made for people who wrote part 1 in a way
that runs slow? To get them to optimize it? Kinda like day 5 part 2 i guess. My part 2 takes
around 500ms which is fine i would say.

First Rust impression: pretty cool.

## Quickstart
To run part 1 or part 2, do:
```sh
$ make part1
$ make part2
```

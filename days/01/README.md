Starting off with my own programming language, Tokiscript. I thought it would be fun to try and do a few days of AOC in a language i made myself.

> [!WARNING]
> Tokiscript is a **very very slow language**, because while making it i did not care about
> performance. Part 1 is relatively fast, but you will have to wait a few seconds for part 2.

## Quickstart
To run part 1 or part 2, do:
```sh
$ make part1
$ make part2
```

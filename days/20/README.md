Part 1 was very fun. I enjoyed this pulse circuit thing. I also used it as an opportunity to try
out Python inheritance with the modules concept. I still cant get over how silly the python class
constructor name `__init__` is.

Part 2 was very confusing on the other hand. I at first didnt get it at all and they also provided
no examples. It turned out to be a LCM problem.

## Quickstart
To run part 1 or part 2, do:
```sh
$ make part1
$ make part2
```

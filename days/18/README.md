First day of Python and another day of using formulas i have never heard of, such as the
[shoelace formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula) or
[Picks theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick%27s_theorem). That aside, Python is Python. An
easy language for getting things done quickly. I dont really see myself using it for any actual
projects in the future, but its nice to know just in case.

## Quickstart
To run part 1 or part 2, do:
```sh
$ make part1
$ make part2
```

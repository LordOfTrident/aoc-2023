This day was harder in Tokiscript since i discovered a Tokiscript bug and i already did not have much
time left today.

I started doing AOC late today so i didnt have time to properly think more about part 2 which really
caught me off guard. Im gonna skip part 2 for now and keep it for later and move on to not slow
myself down. 5 days in tokiscript is enough and i think its time to switch languages.

## Quickstart
To run part 1 or part 2, do:
```sh
$ make part1
$ make part2
```

Fun day. Part 1 was easy and fun primitive gravity simulation, while part 2 was cycle optimization.
I did not need any hints for this days part 2, which im glad.

So, last day of Zig. First day of using Zig was alright, second day i got kinda annoyed by it, but
now im starting to like it. I might try it later, maybe for a tiny project of mine, maybe even
do another 3 days in Zig this AOC. I will see.

## Quickstart
To run part 1 or part 2, do:
```sh
$ make part1
$ make part2
```

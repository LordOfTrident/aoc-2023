# [Day 11](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/11)
In Elixir

Another fun day with a problem that wasnt hard. Again had to think when implementing it using a
functional language, but it went fine. I did my first recursive function with pattern matching
experiment (i took the tail call optimized sum_list implementation from google :D). Though it isnt
the most beautiful, it did its job. As with Rust, after 3 days with Elixir im gonna switch langs.
Tho i liked Elixir so much that i might return to it in the later days.

## Quickstart
To run part 1 or part 2, do:
```sh
$ make part1
$ make part2
```

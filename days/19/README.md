Part 1 was very easy and fun, finally didnt need any formulas i have never heard of. Part 2 was way
trickier tho and i needed some hints, but i got it. While writing the parser for this day, i tried
to see if python has pattern matching and if i can do `[a, b] = c.split(" ")` and predictably, it
does. That made the parser code much better and cleaner.

A visualization for this day could be interesting...

## Quickstart
To run part 1 or part 2, do:
```sh
$ make part1
$ make part2
```

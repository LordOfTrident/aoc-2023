In Rust

Part 1 was easy, however part 2 was interesting. You couldnt bruteforce it because it would be way
way too long. Maybe not even possible. It needed a simple optimization with modulo arithmetic which
i did not realize at first and went to look for a hint.

## Quickstart
To run part 1 or part 2, do:
```sh
$ make part1
$ make part2
```

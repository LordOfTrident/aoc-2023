In Elixir

First impression: really really fun language. My first time programming in an actual functional
language (not a functional/imperative mix like Rust or Tokiscript). It is really interesting and
nice. I will definitely try using elixir for a small project or two of mine.

Tho there was a tiny bit of struggle due to me having the imperative mindset and just jumping into
a functional language without properly reading any tutorials or anything, it went fine. It was also
an easy day so that made it better.

## Quickstart
To run part 1 or part 2, do:
```sh
$ make part1
$ make part2
```

First day of C++. I wanted to do the last 5 days in C++ since i am familiar with the language, but
i havent used it in a while. I also wanted to try out maybe some C++ features i havent used before.
Part 1 was pretty fine but when i saw part 2 i was just like alright, maybe later. I started doing
AOC late today so i was too tired to do part 2.

## Quickstart
To run part 1 or part 2, do:
```sh
$ make part1
$ make part2
```
